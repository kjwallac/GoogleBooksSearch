# Google Books Search
## A React-based Google Books Search App

The Search page allows the user to search for books by title or author through the Google Books API.

Upon searching for a book, the user is presented with two option buttons:  
- View - the user is taken to the Google Books page for that book.
- Save - the user is able to save this book to the database and view a list of saved books on the Saved page.
  - Upon saving a book:
    - the option to save is changed to the option to remove the book from the saved list.
    - a notification pops up informing the user that the book has been saved to the database.
